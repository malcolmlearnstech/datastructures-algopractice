<h3>Write a program that reads an acrostic to identify the "hidden" word. Specifically, your program will receive a list of words (reprensenting an acrostic) and will need to return a <em>string</em> corresponding to the word that is spelled out by taking the first letter of each word in the acrostic.</h3>

<br>

<h3>Example 1:</h3>

<pre>function readOut&nbsp;(&nbsp;['Jolly', 'Amazing', 'Courteous', 'Keen']&nbsp;)</pre>

<p>The function should return the following result: &nbsp;<strong><em>'JACK'</em></strong></p>

<br>

<h3>Example 2:</h3>

<pre>function readOut&nbsp;(&nbsp;['Marvelous', 'Excellent', 'Gifted']&nbsp;)</pre>

<p>The function should return the following result: &nbsp;<strong><em>'MEG'</em></strong></p>

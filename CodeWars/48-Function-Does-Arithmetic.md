</div>

<div align "center">

<h3>Given two numbers and an arithmetic operator (the name of it, as a string), return the result of the two numbers having that operator used on them.</h3>

<h3>a and b will both be positive integers, and a will always be the first number in the operation, and b always the second.</h3>

<h3>The four operators are "add", "subtract", "divide", "multiply".</h3>

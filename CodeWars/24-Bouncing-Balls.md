<div align = "center">

<h3>A child is playing with a ball on the nth floor of a tall building. The height of this floor above ground level, <em>h</em>, is known. He drops the ball out of the window. The ball bounces (for example), to two-thirds of its height (a bounce of 0.66). His mother looks out of a window 1.5 meters from the ground. How many times will the mother see the ball pass in front of her window (including when it's falling <em>and</em> bouncing?</h3>

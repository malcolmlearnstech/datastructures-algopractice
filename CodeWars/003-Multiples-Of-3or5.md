# Multiples of 3 or 5
  </div>

<div align = "center">
  
<h3> If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, 
we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. </h3>
<h3>Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 
below the number passed in. Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0 
(for languages that do have them).

</h3>

<h3><em>Note: If the number is a <strong>multiple of both 3 and 5</strong>, only count it once.</em></h3>

</div>

<h3>Example 1:</h3>
<pre>
Input: 10 
</pre>

<p>
<em>The numbers between 10 and 0 that are multiples of 3 or 5 are the following: 9, 6, 5, 3. These numbers will be added.
  
  The function will return <strong>23</strong>
    </em>
</p>

<h3>Example 2:</h3>
<pre>
Input: 17 
</pre>

<p>
<em>The numbers between 17 and 0 that are multiples of 3 or 5 are the following: 15, 12, 10, 9, 6, 5, and 3. These numbers will be added. 
  
  The function will return <strong>60</strong>
  </em>
</p>

<h3>Example 3:</h3>
<pre>
Input: -29
</pre>

<p>
<em>Because the input is a negative number and the prompt asks the function to add natural numbers, there are no none between the input and 0.

The function will return <strong>0</strong></em>

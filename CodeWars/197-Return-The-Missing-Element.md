# Return the Missing Element

</div>

<div align = 'center'>

<h3>Fellow code warrior, we need your help! We seem to have lost one of our sequence elements, and we need your help to retrieve it!</h3>

<h3>Our sequence given was supposed to contain all of the integers from 0 to 9 (in no particular order), but one of them seems to be missing.</h3>

<h3>Write a function that accepts a sequence of unique integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive), and returns the missing element.</h3>

<br>

<h3>Example 1:</h3>

<pre>function getMissingElement&nbsp;(&nbsp;[&nbsp;0, 5, 1, 3, 2, 9, 7, 6, 4&nbsp;]&nbsp;)</pre>

<p>The function should return the following result: &nbsp;<strong><em>8</em></strong></p>

<br>

<h3>Example 2:</h3>

<pre>function getMissingElement&nbsp;(&nbsp;[&nbsp;9, 2, 4, 5, 7, 0, 8, 6, 1&nbsp;]&nbsp;)</pre>

<p>The function should return the following result: &nbsp;<strong><em>3</em></strong></p>

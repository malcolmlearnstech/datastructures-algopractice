<h3>Fellow code warrior, we need your help! We seem to have lost one of our sequence elements, and we need your help to retrieve it!</h3>

<h3>Our sequence given was supposed to contain all of the integers from 0 to 9 (in no particular order), but one of them seems to be missing.</h3>

<h3>Write a function that accepts a sequence of unique integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive), and returns the missing element.</h3>

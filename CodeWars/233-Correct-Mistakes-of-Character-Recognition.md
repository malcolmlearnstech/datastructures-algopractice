<div align = "center">

<h3>Character recognition software is widely used to digitise printed texts. Thus the texts can be edited, searched and stored on a computer.</h3>

<h3>When documents (especially pretty old ones written with a typewriter), are digitised character recognition softwares often make mistakes.</h3>

<h3>Your task is to correct the errors in the digitised text. You only have to handle the following mistakes.</h3>

<h3>•&nbsp;<em>S</em> is misinterpreted as <em>5</em></h3>

<h3>•&nbsp;<em>O</em> is misinterpreted as <em>0</em></h3>

<h3>•&nbsp;<em>I</em> is misinterpreted as <em>1</em></h3>

<h3>The test cases contain numbers only by mistake.</h3>

<br>

<h3>Example 1:</h3>

<pre>function correct&nbsp;(&nbsp;'L0ND0N'&nbsp;)</pre>

<p>The function should return the following result: &nbsp;<strong><em>'LONDON'</em></strong></p>

<br>

<h3>Example 2:</h3>

<pre>function correct&nbsp;(&nbsp;'51NGAP0RE'&nbsp;)</pre>

<p>The function should return the following result: &nbsp;<strong><em>'SINGAPORE'</em></strong></p>

<br>

<h3>Example 3:</h3>

<pre>function correct&nbsp;(&nbsp;'BUDAPE5T'&nbsp;)</pre>

<p>The function should return the following result: &nbsp;<strong><em>'BUDAPEST'</em></strong></p>

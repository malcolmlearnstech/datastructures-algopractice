# Numbers in Strings

<div align = 'center'>

<h3>In this Kata, you will be given a string that has lowercase letters and numbers. Your task is to compare the number groupings and return the largest number. Numbers will not have leading zeros.</h3>

<h3>For example, solve("gh12cdy695m1") = 695, because this is the largest of all number groupings.</h3>

<h3>Good luck!</h3>

<h3>You are going to be given a word. Your job will be to make sure that each character in that word has the exact same number of occurrences. You will return <em>true</em> if it is valid, or <em>false</em> if it is not.</h3>

<br>

<h3>For this kata, capitals are considered the same as lowercase letters. Therefore: <em>"A" == "a"</em></h3>

<br>

<h3>The input is a string (with no spaces) containing <em>[a-z],[A-Z],[0-9]</em> and common symbols. The length will be <em>0 < length < 100</em>.</h3>

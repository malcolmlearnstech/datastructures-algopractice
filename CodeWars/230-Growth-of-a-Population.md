# Growth of a Population

</div>

<div align = "center">

<h3>In a small town the population is <em>p0 = 1000</em> at the beginning of a year. The population regularly increases by <em>2 percent</em> per year and moreover <em>50 new inhabitants</em> per year come to live in the town. How many years does the town need to see its population greater than or equal to <em>p = 1200</em> inhabitants?</h3>

<h3>More generally given parameters:</h3>

<h3><em>p0, percent, aug (inhabitants coming or leaving each year), p (population to equal or surpass)</em></h3>

<h3>The function <em>nb_year</em> should return <em>n</em> number of entire years needed to get a population greater or equal to <em>p</em>.</h3>

<h3><em>aug</em> is an integer, <em>percent</em> a positive or null floating number, <em>p0 and p</em> are positive integers (> 0)</h3>

<h3>Note:</h3>

<h3>â€¢&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Don't forget to convert the percent parameter as a percentage in the body of your function: if the parameter percent is 2 you have to convert it to 0.02.</em></h3>

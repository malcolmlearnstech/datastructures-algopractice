<h3>Given a lowercase string that has alphabetic characters only and no spaces, return the highest value of consonant substrings. Consonants are any letters of the alphabet except "<em>aeiou</em>".</h3>

<br>

<h3>We shall assign the following values: &nbsp; <strong>a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, .... z = 26</strong></h3>

<br>

<h3>For example, for the word "zodiacs", let's cross out the vowels. We get: "z ~~o~~ d ~~ia~~ cs"</h3>

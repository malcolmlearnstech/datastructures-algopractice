<h3>Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.</h3>

<h3>It should remove all values from list <em>a</em>, which are present in list <em>b</em> keeping their order.</h3>
<br>

<pre><em>arrayDiff([1,2],[1])</em> would return the following:&nbsp;<strong><em>[2]</em></strong></pre>
<br>

<h3><p>If a value is present in <em>b</em>, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:</p></h3>
<br>

<pre><em>arrayDiff([1,2,2,2,3],[2])</em> would return the following:&nbsp;<strong><em>[1,3]</em></strong></pre>

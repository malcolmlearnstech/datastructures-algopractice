# Disemvowel Trolls

</div>

<div align = "center">

<h3>Trolls are attacking your comment section!</h3>

<h3>A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.</h3>

<h3>Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.</h3>

<h3>For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".</h3>

<h3><em>Note: for this kata "y" isn't considered a vowel.</em></h3>

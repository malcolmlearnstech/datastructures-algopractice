<div align = "center">

<h3>Several people are standing in a row <em>divided into two teams</em>.</h3>
<h3>The first person goes into <em>team 1</em>, the second goes into <em>team 2</em>, the third goes into <em>team 1</em>, and so on.</h3>

<h3>Given an array of positive integers (the weights of the people), return a new array/tuple of two integers, <em>where the first one</em> is the <em>total weight of team 1</em>, and <em>the second one</em> is the <em>total weight of team 2</em>.</h3>

### Notes

<p>• Array size is at least 1.</p>
<p>• <em>All numbers</em> will be positive.</p>

<br>

<h3>Example 1:</h3>

<pre>rowWeights([13, 27, 49])</pre>

<p>The function will return the following array: &nbsp;<strong>[&nbsp;62, 27&nbsp;]</strong></p>

<br>

<h3>Example 2:</h3>

<pre>rowWeights([50,60,70,80])</pre>

<p>The function will return the following array: &nbsp;<strong>[&nbsp;120, 140&nbsp;]</strong></p>

<br>

<h3>Example 3:</h3>

<pre>rowWeights([29,83,67,53,19,28,96])</pre>

<p>The function will return the following array: &nbsp;<strong>[&nbsp;211, 164&nbsp;]</strong></p>

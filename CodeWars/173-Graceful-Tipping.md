# Graceful Tipping

</div>

<div align = 'center'>

<h3>Adding tip to a restaurant bill in a graceful way can be tricky, thats why you need make a function for it.</h3>

<h3>The function will receive the restaurant bill (always a positive number) as an argument. You need to <em>1)</em> <strong>add at least 15%</strong> in tip, <em>2)</em> round that number up to an <em>elegant</em> value and <em>3)</em> return it.</h3>

<h3>What is an <em>elegant</em> number? It depends on the magnitude of the number to be rounded. Numbers below 10 should simply be rounded to whole numbers. Numbers 10 and above should be rounded like this:</h3>

<h4>10 - 99.99... ---> Round to number divisible by 5</h4>
<h4>100 - 999.99... ---> Round to number divisible by 50</h4>
<h4>1000 - 9999.99... ---> Round to number divisible by 500</h4>
<h4>And so on...</h4>

<h3>Good luck!</h3>

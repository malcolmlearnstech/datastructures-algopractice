<h3>Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only your friends name in it.</h3>

<h3>If a name has exactly 4 letters in it, you can be sure that it has to be a friend of yours! Otherwise, you can be sure he's not...</h3>

<h3>Example 1:</h3>

<pre>friend(["Ryan", "Kieran", "Jason", "Yous"])</pre>

<p>The function will return: &nbsp;<strong><em>["Ryan", "Yous"]</em></strong></p>

<h3>Example 2:</h3>

<pre>friend(["Ryan", "Kieran", "Mark"])</pre>

<p>The function will return: &nbsp;<strong><em>["Ryan", "Mark"]</em></strong></p>

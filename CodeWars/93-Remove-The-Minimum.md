# Remove the Minimum

</div>

<div align = "center">

<h3>The museum of incredible dull things wants to get rid of some exhibitions. Miriam, the interior architect, comes up with a plan to remove the most boring exhibitions. She gives them a rating, and then removes the one with the lowest rating.</h3>

<br>

<h3>However, just as she finished rating all exhibitions, she's off to an important fair, so she asks you to write a program that tells her the ratings of the items after one removed the lowest one. Fair enough.</h3>

<br>

<h2><em>Task</em></h2>

<h3>Given an array of integers, remove the smallest value. <strong>Do not mutate the original array/list.</strong> If there are multiple elements with the same value, remove the one with a lower index. If you get an empty array/list, return an empty array/list.

<br>

Don't change the order of the elements that are left.</h3>

<br>

<h3>Example 1:</h3>

<pre>removeSmallest(&nbsp;[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]&nbsp;)</pre>

<p>The function will return the following array: &nbsp;<em><strong>[2, 3, 4, 5]</strong></em></p>

<br>

<h3>Example 2:</h3>

<pre>removeSmallest(&nbsp;[5, 3, 2, 1, 4]&nbsp;)</pre>

<p>The function will return the following array: &nbsp;<em><strong>[5, 3, 2, 4]</strong></em></p>

<br>

<h3>Example 3:</h3>

<pre>removeSmallest(&nbsp;[2, 2, 1, 2, 1]&nbsp;)</pre>

<p>The function will return the following array: &nbsp;<em><strong>[2, 2, 2, 1]</strong></em></p>

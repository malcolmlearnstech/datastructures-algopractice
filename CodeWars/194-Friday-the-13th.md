<h3>It's Friday the 13th, and Jason is ready for his first killing spree!</h3>

<h3>Create a function, killcount, that accepts two arguments: an array of array pairs (the conselor's name and intelligence - ["Chad", 2]) and an integer representing Jason's intellegence.</h3>

<pre>
var counselors = [["Chad", 2], ["Tommy", 9]];
var jason = 7;
</pre>

<h3>Your function must return an array of the names of all the counselors who can be outsmarted and killed by Jason.</h3>

<h3>Happy Friday the 13th!</h3>

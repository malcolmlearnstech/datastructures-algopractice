<h3>Let's implement the zipObject function that enables such results</h3>

<h3>The zipObject creates an object composed from arrays of keys and values. It is provided with either a single two dimensional array, i.e. [[key1, value1], [key2, value2]] or with two arrays, one of keys and one of corresponding values.</h3>

<h3>If only keys are given, then set the values to undefined.</h3>

<h3>If neither keys nor values are specified, then return {}</h3>

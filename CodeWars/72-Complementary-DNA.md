# Complementary DNA

<h3>Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus of cells and carries the "instructions" for the development and functioning of living organisms.</h3>
<br>

<h3>In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". Your function receives one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to return the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).</h3>
<br>

<h3>Example 1:</h3>

<pre>dnaStrand("ATTGC")</pre>

<p>The function will return the following string: &nbsp;<em><strong>"TAACG"</strong></em></p>
<br>

<h3>Example 1:</h3>

<pre>dnaStrand("GTAT")</pre>

<p>The function will return the following string: &nbsp;<em><strong>"CATA"</strong></em></p>

<h3>The marketing team is spending way too much time typing in hashtags.</h3>
<h3>Let's help them with our own Hashtag Generator!</h3>

<br>

<h3>Here's the deal:</h3>
<h3>• <em>It must start with a hashtag (#)</em>.</h3>
<h3>• <em>All words must have their first letter capitalized</em>.</h3>
<h3>• <em>If the final result is longer than 140 chars it must return <strong>false</strong></em>.</h3>
<h3>• <em>If the input or the result is an empty string it must return <strong>false</strong></em>.</h3>

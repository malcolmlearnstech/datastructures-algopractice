<h3>What if we need the length of the words separated by a space to be added at the end of that same word and have it returned as an array?</h3>

<h3>Your task is to write a function that takes a String and returns an Array/list with the length of each word added to each element.</h3>

<h3><em>Note:</em> String will have at least one element; words will always be separated by a space.</h3>

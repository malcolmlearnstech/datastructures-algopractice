# Add Length

</div>

<div align = "center">

<h3>What if we need the length of the words separated by a space to be added at the end of that same word and have it returned as an array?</h3>

<h3>Your task is to write a function that takes a String and returns an Array/list with the length of each word added to each element.</h3>

<h3><em>Note:</em> String will have at least one element; words will always be separated by a space.</h3>

<br>

<h3>Example 1:</h3>

<pre>addLength(&nbsp;"apple ban"&nbsp;)</pre>

<p>The function will return the following array: &nbsp;<em><strong>["apple 5", "ban 3"]</strong></em></p>

<br>

<h3>Example 2:</h3>

<pre>addLength(&nbsp;"you will win"&nbsp;)</pre>

<p>The function will return the following array: &nbsp;<em><strong>["you 3", "will 4", "win 3"]</strong></em></p>

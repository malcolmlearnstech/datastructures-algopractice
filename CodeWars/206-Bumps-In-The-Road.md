<h3>Your car is old, it breaks easily. The shock absorbers are gone and you think it can handle about 15 more bumps before it dies totally.</h3>

<h3>Unfortunately for you, your drive is very bumpy! Given a string showing either flat road (&nbsp;<em> _</em>&nbsp;) or bumps (&nbsp;<em>n</em>&nbsp;). If you are able to reach home safely by encountering <em>15 bumps or less</em>, return <em>Woohoo!</em>, otherwise return <em>Car Dead</em></h3>

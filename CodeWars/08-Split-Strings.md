# Split Strings
  </div>

  <h3> Complete the solution so that it splits the string into pairs of two characters. </h3>
  <h3>If the string contains an odd number of characters then it should replace the missing second character of the final pair with an underscore ('_'). </h3>

</div>

<h3>Example 1:</h3>
<pre>
Input: <em>'abc' </em>
</pre>

<p>
<em>Because the string has an odd number of characters, the second pair will have an underscore added to it.
  
 The function will return an array with the following:    <strong>['ab', 'c_']</strong>
    </em>
</p>

<h3>Example 2:</h3>
<pre>
Input: <em>'abcdef' </em>
</pre>

<p>
<em>Because the string has an even number of characters, every pair of characters will be filled in with no underscores.
  
  The function will return an array with the following:    <strong>['ab', 'cd', 'ef']</strong>
  </em>
</p>


<!--
<h3>Example 3:</h3>
<pre>
Input: [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
</pre>

<p>
<em>Given the rules from the prompt, the numbers 8, 6, 4, 2, and 0 will remain in their positions.
The positions of 9, 7, 5, 3, and 1 will have to be swapped and placed in ascending order due to the prompt.

<strong>The function will return [1, 8, 3, 6, 5, 4, 7, 2, 9, 0]</strong></em>

</p>

<h3>You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" N.</h3>

<h3>Example 1:</h3>

<pre>findOutlier([2, 4, 0, 100, 4, 11, 2602, 36])</pre>

<p>The function will return: &nbsp;<em><strong>11</strong>&nbsp;(the only odd number)</em></p>

<h3>Example 2:</h3>

<pre>findOutlier([160, 3, 1719, 19, 11, 13, -21])</pre>

<p>The function will return: &nbsp;<em><strong>160</strong>&nbsp;(the only odd number)</em></p>

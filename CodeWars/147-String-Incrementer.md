<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;If the string already ends with a number, the number should be incremented by 1.</h3> 
<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;If the string does not end with a number. the number 1 should be appended to the new string.</h3>

<h4><em>Attention: If the number has leading zeros the amount of digits should be considered.</em></h4>

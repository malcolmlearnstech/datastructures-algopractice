<h3>In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?</h3>

<h3>Notes:</h3>
<ul>
    <li> <em>The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.</em> </li>
    <li> <em>Zero (0) is not checked for any specific sign. Negative zeros make no mathematical sense.</em> </li>
</ul>

<h3>You have a group chat application, but who is online!?</h3>

<h3>You want to show your users which of their friends are online and available to chat!</h3>

<h3>Given an input of an array of objects containing usernames, status and time since last activity (in mins), create a function to work out who is <em>online</em>, <em>offline</em> and <em>away</em>.</h3>

<h3>If someone is online but their <em>lastActivity</em> was more than 10 minutes ago they are to be considered <em>away</em>.</h3>

<h3>Complete the function that takes a list of numbers (&nbsp;<strong>nums</strong>&nbsp;), as the only argument to the function. Take each number in the list and <em>square</em> it if it is even, or <em>square root</em> the number if it is odd. Take this new list and return the <em>sum</em> of it, rounded to two decimal places.</h3>

<h3>The list will never be empty and will only contain values that are greater than or equal to zero.</h3>

<h3>Write a function that takes an array of words and smashes them together into a sentence and returns the sentence.</h3>

<br>

<h3>You can ignore any need to sanitize words or add punctuation, but you should add spaces between each word.</h3>

<br>

<h3><strong>Be careful, there shouldn't be a space at the beginning or the end of the sentence!</strong></h3>

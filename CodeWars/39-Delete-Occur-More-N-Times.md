<h3>Given a list and a number, create a new list that contains each number of list at most N times, without reordering.<h3>

<h3>For example if the input number is &nbsp;<em>2</em>, and the input list is &nbsp;<em>[1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3]</em>, you take &nbsp;<em>[1,2,3,1,2]</em>, drop the next &nbsp;<em>[1,2]</em> since this would lead to &nbsp;<em>1</em> and &nbsp;<em>2</em> being in the result &nbsp;<em>3</em> times, and then take &nbsp;<em>3</em>, which leads to &nbsp;<em>[1,2,3,1,2,3]</em>.<h3>

<h3>With list &nbsp;<em>[20,37,20,21]</em> and number &nbsp;<em>1</em>, the result would be &nbsp;<em>[20,37,21]</em>.<h3>

<h3>Ava, Mark, Sheila, and Pete are at a party. However, Ava and Sheila are only staying if there are at least 4 people, Pete is only staying if there's at least 1 person, and Mark is only staying if there are at least 5 people. Therefore, Mark leaves, which makes Ava and Sheila leave, and Pete is left alone.</h3>

<h3>Given an array with the preferences of every person at a party for the minimum number of people present, determine how many people will stay.</h3>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>

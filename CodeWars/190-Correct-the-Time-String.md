# Correct the Time String

</div>

<div align = 'center'>

<h3>A new task for you!</h3>

<p>•&nbsp;You have to create a method, that corrects a given time string.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;There was a problem in addition, so many of the time strings are broken.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Time is formatted using the 24-hour clock, so from <em>00:00:00</em> to </em>23:59:59</em>.</p>

<h3>If the input-string is null or empty return exactly its value! If the time-string-format is invalid, return null.</h3>

</div>

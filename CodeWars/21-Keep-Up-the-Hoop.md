<h3>Alex just got a new hula hoop, he loves it but feels discouraged because his little brother is better than him.</h3>

<h3>Write a program where Alex can input (n) how many times the hoop goes round and it will return him an encouraging message :)</h3>

<pre>
<em>If Alex gets 10 or more hoops, return the string "Great, now move on to tricks".

<pre>
<em>If he doesn't get 10 hoops, return the string "Keep at it until you get it".

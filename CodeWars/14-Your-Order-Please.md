<h3> Your task is to sort a given string. Each word in the string will contain a single number. This number is the position the word should have in the result. </h3>
  <h3> Note: Numbers can be from 1 to 9. So 1 will be the first word (not 0). </h3>
  <h3> If the input string is empty, return an empty string. The words in the input String will only contain valid consecutive numbers. </h3>
  
  </div>

<h3>Example 1:</h3>
<pre>
Input: <em>"is2 Thi1s T4est 3a"</em>
</pre>

<p>
<em>Because the string has an odd number of characters, the second pair will have an underscore added to it.
  
 The function will return an array with the following:    <strong>"Thi1s is2 3a T4est"</strong>
    </em>
</p>

<h3>Example 2:</h3>
<pre>
Input: <em>"4of Fo1r pe6ople g3ood th5e the2"</em>
</pre>

<p>
<em>Because the string has an even number of characters, every pair of characters will be filled in with no underscores.
  
  The function will return an array with the following:    <strong>"Fo1r the2 g3ood 4of th5e pe6ople"</strong>
  </em>
</p>

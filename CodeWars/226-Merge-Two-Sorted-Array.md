# Merge Two Shorted Arrays into One

</div>

<div align = "center">

<h3>You are given two sorted arrays that both only contain integers. Your task is to find a way to merge them into a single one, sorted in asc order. Complete the function mergeArrays (&nbsp;<em>arr1</em>, <em>arr2</em>&nbsp;), where <em>arr1</em> and <em>arr2</em> are the original sorted arrays.</h3>

<h3>You don't need to worry about validation, since <em>arr1</em> and <em>arr2</em> must be arrays with 0 or more Integers. If both <em>arr1</em> and <em>arr2</em> are empty, then just return an empty array.</h3>

<h3><em>Note: arr1 and arr2 may be sorted in different orders. Also arr1 and arr2 may have same integers. Remove duplicated in the returned result.</em></h3>

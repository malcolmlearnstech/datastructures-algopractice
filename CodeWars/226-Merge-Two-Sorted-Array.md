# Merge Two Shorted Arrays into One

</div>

<div align = "center">

<h3>You are given two sorted arrays that both only contain integers. Your task is to find a way to merge them into a single one, sorted in asc order. Complete the function mergeArrays (&nbsp;<em>arr1</em>, <em>arr2</em>&nbsp;), where <em>arr1</em> and <em>arr2</em> are the original sorted arrays.</h3>

<h3>You don't need to worry about validation, since <em>arr1</em> and <em>arr2</em> must be arrays with 0 or more Integers. If both <em>arr1</em> and <em>arr2</em> are empty, then just return an empty array.</h3>

<h3><em>Note: arr1 and arr2 may be sorted in different orders. Also arr1 and arr2 may have same integers. Remove duplicated in the returned result.</em></h3>

<br>

<h3>Example 1:</h3>

<pre>function mergeArrays&nbsp;(&nbsp;[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]&nbsp;)</pre>

<p>The function should return the following result: &nbsp;<strong><em>[&nbsp;1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10&nbsp;]</em></strong></p>

<br>

<h3>Example 2:</h3>

<pre>function mergeArrays&nbsp;(&nbsp;[1, 3, 5, 7, 9], [10, 8, 6, 4, 2]&nbsp;)</pre>

<p>The function should return the following result: &nbsp;<strong><em>[&nbsp;1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10&nbsp;]</em></strong></p>

<br>

<h3>Example 2:</h3>

<pre>function mergeArrays&nbsp;(&nbsp;[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 12]&nbsp;)</pre>

<p>The function should return the following result: &nbsp;<strong><em>[&nbsp;1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12&nbsp;]</em></strong></p>

<h3>The first input array is the key to the correct answers to an exam, like <em>["a", "a", "b", "d"]</em>. The second one contains a student's submitted answers.</h3>

<h3>The two arrays are not empty and are the same length. Return the score for this array of answers, giving +4 for each correct answer, -1 for each incorrect answer, and +0 for each blank answer, represented as an empty string (in C the space character is used).</h3>

<h3>If the score < 0, return 0.</h3>

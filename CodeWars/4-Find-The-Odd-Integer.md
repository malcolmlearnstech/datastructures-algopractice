# Find the Integer

<div align = "center">
  
<h3> Given an array of integers, find the one that appears an odd number of times. </h3>
<h3>There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times.</h3>
  
  
</div>

<h3>Example 1</h3>
<pre>
<!--
<span class="CodeEditor-promptParameter">array</span> = [6,2]
-->
[7] should return 7, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
</pre>

<h3>Example 2</h3>
<pre>
[1,1,2] should return 2, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).</pre>

<h3>Example 3</h3>
<pre>
[1,2,2,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,2,2,1] should return 4, because it appears 1 time (which is odd).
</pre>

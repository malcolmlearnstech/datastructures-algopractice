# Printer Errors

</div>

<div align = "center">

<h3>In a factory a printer prints labels for boxes. For one kind of boxes the printer has to use colors which, for the sake of simplicity, are named with letters from <em>a to m</em>.</h3>

<h3>The colors used by the printer are recorded in a control string. For example a "good" control string would be <em>aaabbbbhaijjjm</em> meaning that the printer used three times color a, four times color b, one time color h then one time color a...</h3>

<h3>Sometimes there are problems: lack of colors, technical malfunction and a "bad" control string is produced e.g. <em>aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm</em> with letters not from <em>a to m</em>.</h3>

<h3>You have to write a function <em>printer_error</em> which given a string will return the error rate of the printer as a string representing a rational whose numerator is the number of errors and the denominator the length of the control string. Don't reduce this fraction to a simpler expression.</h3>

<h3>The string has a length greater or equal to one and contains only letters from <em>a to z</em>.</h3>

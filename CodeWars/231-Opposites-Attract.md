<h3>Timmy & Sarah think they are in love, but around where they live, they will only know once they pick a flower each. If one of the flowers has an even number of petals and the other has an odd number of petals it means they are in love.</h3>

<h3>Write a function that will take the number of petals of each flower and return true if they are in love and false if they aren't.</h3>

<br>

<h3>Example 1:</h3>

<pre>function lovefunc&nbsp;(&nbsp;1, 4&nbsp;)</pre>

<p>The function should return the following result: &nbsp;<strong><em>true</em></strong></p>

<br>

<h3>Example 2:</h3>

<pre>function lovefunc&nbsp;(&nbsp;2, 2&nbsp;)</pre>

<p>The function should return the following result: &nbsp;<strong><em>false</em></strong></p>

<br>

<h3>Example 3:</h3>

<pre>function lovefunc&nbsp;(&nbsp;0, 1&nbsp;)</pre>

<p>The function should return the following result: &nbsp;<strong><em>true</em></strong></p>

# Get the Middle Character

<div align = "center">
  
<h3> You are going to be given a word. Your job is to return the middle character of the word. </h3>
  <h3> If the word's length is odd, return the middle character. </h3>
  <h3> If the word's length is even, return the middle 2 characters. </h3>



</div>

<h3>Example 1:</h3>
<pre>
Input: "the-stealth-warrior" 
</pre>

<p>
<em>The dashes will be removed and only the first letters of "stealth" and "warrior" will be capitalized.
  
  The function will return <strong>"theStealthWarrior"</strong>
    </em>
</p>

<h3>Example 2:</h3>
<pre>
Input: "The_Stealth_Warrior" 
</pre>

<p>
<em>The underscores will be removed and because the first word is capitalized, all three words will be capitalized. 
  
  The function will return <strong>"TheStealthWarrior"</strong>
  </em>
</p>


<!--
<h3>Example 3:</h3>
<pre>
Input: [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
</pre>

<p>
<em>Given the rules from the prompt, the numbers 8, 6, 4, 2, and 0 will remain in their positions.
The positions of 9, 7, 5, 3, and 1 will have to be swapped and placed in ascending order due to the prompt.

<strong>The function will return [1, 8, 3, 6, 5, 4, 7, 2, 9, 0]</strong></em>

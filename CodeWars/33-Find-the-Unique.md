# Find the Unique Number

<div align = "center">

<h3>There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!</h3>

<pre>
findUniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) === 2

findUniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) === 0.55
</pre>

<h3>Itâ€™s guaranteed that array contains at least 3 numbers.</h3>

<h3>The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.</h3>

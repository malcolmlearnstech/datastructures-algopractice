<h3>Given a string indicating a range of letters, return a string which includes all the letters in that range, <em>including</em> the last letter.</h3>

<h3>Note that if the range is given in <em>capital</em> letters, return the string in capitals also!</h3>

<h3>Notes:</h3>
<h4>•&nbsp;A <em>hyphen</em> will separate the two letters in the string.</h4>
<h4>•&nbsp;You don't need to worry about error handling in this kata (i.e. both letters will be the same case and the second letter will not be before the first alphabetically).</h4>

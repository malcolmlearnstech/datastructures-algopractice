<h3> Create a function which answers the question "Are you playing banjo?" </h3>
  <h3> If your name starts with the letter "R" or lower case "r", you are playing banjo! </h3>
  <h3> The function takes a name as its only argument, and returns one of the following strings: </h3>

<pre>
name + " plays banjo" 


name + " does not play banjo"
</pre>

<h3> Names given are always valid strings.</h3>

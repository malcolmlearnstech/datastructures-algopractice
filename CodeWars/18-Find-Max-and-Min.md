<h3> Your task is to make two functions ( max and min, or maximum and minimum, etc., depending on the language ) that receive a list of integers as input, and return the largest and lowest number in that list, respectively.
 </h3>

 <h3>Note:</h3>
 <h3>You may consider that there will not be any empty arrays/vectors.</h3>

<h3>Example 1:</h3>
<pre>
Input: <em>[4,6,2,1,9,63,-134,566]</em>
</pre>

<p>
 
<em>The function will return a max of <strong>566</strong> and min of <strong>-134</strong>
    </em>

# Count Characters in Your String

</div>

<div align = "center">

<h3>The main idea is to count all the occurring characters in a string. If you have a string like aba, then the result should be {'a': 2, 'b': 1}.</h3>

<h3>What if the string is empty? Then the result should be empty object literal, {}.</h3>

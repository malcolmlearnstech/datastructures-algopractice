# Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target (LeetCode #744)

</div>

<div align = "center">

<h3>You are given an array of characters "letters" that is sorted in <em>non-decreasing order</em>, and a character "target". There are at least two different characters in "letters".</h3>

<h3>Return <em>the smallest character</em> in "letters" <em>that is lexicographically greater</em> than target. If such a character does not exist, return the first character in letters.</h3>

<br>

<h3>Example 1:</h3>

<pre>nextGreatestLetter(&nbsp;["c", "f", "j"], "a"&nbsp;)</pre>

<p>The function will return the following result: <em><strong>"c"</strong></em></p>
<p><em>The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'a' in letters is 'c'.</em></p>

<br>

<h3>Example 2:</h3>

<pre>nextGreatestLetter(&nbsp;["c", "f", "j"], "c"&nbsp;)</pre>

<p>The function will return the following result: <em><strong>"f"</strong></em></p>
<p><em>The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'c' in letters is 'f'.</em></p>

<br>

<h3>Example 3:</h3>

<pre>nextGreatestLetter(&nbsp;["x", "x", "y", "y"], "z"&nbsp;)</pre>

<p>The function will return the following result: <em><strong>"x"</strong></em></p>
<p><em>There are no characters in letters that is lexicographically greater than 'z' so we return letters[0].</em></p>
